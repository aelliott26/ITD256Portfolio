    <h3>This project was a deep dive into CockroachDB's system.</h3>
  </section>
  <section class="features">
    <div class="feature">
      <p>The reason for this investigation was to learn about a database system that is not a relational database. Our instructor wanted us to realize that there are many different types of databases out there, and gave us each one to research. To research this, I found a tutorial on CockroachDB from their website, and pulled from their example github. The content below is a formated written up version of all of my findings and realizations.</p>
          <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database management system.</li>
      <li>This basically means that the data is distributed among many devices, all linked together.</li>
      <li>Even though the data is distributed, CockroachDB allows you to query the data as if it were all in one place.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why use it?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One main reason to use CockroachDB is for its huge horizontal scaling, as you can add a huge number of devices.</li>
      <li>The other main reason to use CockroachDB is for its high fault tolerance.</li>
      <li>It is super difficult to lose all the data as it is stored across many devices.</li>
      <li>Google uses a similar system, but CockroachDB does not require special hardware to complete the same task as Google.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to use it for?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CockroachDB can be used for massive horizontal scaling, and you can constantly add more devices without reaching a bottleneck.</li>
      <li>It has high availability due to the data being replicated among a lot of different devices.</li>
      <li>It is good for storing data worldwide, as data can be stored locally.</li>
      <li>It has a super high fault tolerance, so it is hard to get taken down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Examples of companies that use it</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Netflix</li>
      <li>Uber</li>
      <li>eBay</li>
      <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
      <li>Google</li>
    </ul>
